# Fouleck Pizza

This repository contains the fully working version of the Fouleck Pizza site with a complete backend and database. This project comes from an old student project back from 2019.

In this version, the site is fully working. You can place orders in your basket and go to checkout to actually order some pizza.

The backend is done in Java JEE which is a version of Java that allows to develop backend for web applications. It also has a SQL databse to store orders.

The goal of this project was to improve our skills in developing web application with JEE backends.
